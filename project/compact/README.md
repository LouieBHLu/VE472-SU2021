Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install the environment named `compact` (change its name in the first line of `environment.yml` file)

On Ubuntu, if error occurs at installing `pygresql` with info upon `libpq-fe.h`, please install it via `sudo apt install libpq-dev` (which contains missing headers).
