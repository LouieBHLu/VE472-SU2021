## Advanced Analysis with the new Tables

1. The top 3 most common professions among these people and also the average life span of these three professions

```python
for row in c.execute("SELECT profession, COUNT (*) as num, AVG(lifespan) FROM profession_lifespan GROUP BY profession ORDER BY num DESC LIMIT 3;"):
    print(row)

('actor', 68553, 69.67861362741236)
('writer', 35068, 71.69427968518308)
