## Pre-processing

- The range of KLHL17 is 10.11507928; the range of HES4 is 10.812213.
- Yes, it's necessary to perform data standardization because the variance of the data is great.

## PCA Analysis

- The number of features of this dataset is too great. PCA can help to identify the most principal columns.
- The two first principal components explain 0.0294+0.0131=0.0425=4.25% of the dataset
- Not so much, because the two first principal components does not explain a lot of the dataset.
- From the scatter we plot, we can see that different types are pretty much separated by those 2 principal features. However, the type in blue is not separated clearly. More features need to be added to get a better performance.
- We then randomly choose two features and draw another plot. We can see we can barely separated different types of cells. Therefore, PCA does its job to some extent.


## Categorization using Gradient Descent
- As we can see, the error rate of the predict result is 0.327. Therefore, we may need a better model.
- We may use multilayer perceptron, which is better at handling high-dimensional and poor-linear data.
