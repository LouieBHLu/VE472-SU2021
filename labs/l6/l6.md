## Drill tasks

First, we create a table based on all data of the weather dataset

````sql
create table dfs.tmp.`weather` as select * from (select columns[16] as Origin, columns[25] as WeatherDelay, columns[8] as UniqueCarrier, columns[14] as ArrDelay from dfs.`/home/hadoop/Desktop/l6/flight_data/*.csv.bz2`);
````

- Three most commonly late origins, due to bad weather.

```sql
select Origin, count(*) as num from (select Origin, WeatherDelay from dfs.tmp.`weather` where WeatherDelay <> '0' and WeatherDelay <> 'WeatherDelay' and WeatherDelay <> 'NA') GROUP BY Origin ORDER BY num DESC limit 3;
```
- Most commonly late carrier

```sql
select UniqueCarrier, count(*) as num from (select UniqueCarrier, ArrDelay from dfs.tmp.`weather` where ArrDelay <> '0' and ArrDelay <> 'ArrDelay' and ArrDelay <> 'NA') GROUP BY UniqueCarrier ORDER BY num DESC limit 1;
```

- Longest delay experienced for each carrier

```sql
select UniqueCarrier, max(cast(ArrDelay as int)) as max_delay from (select * from dfs.tmp.`weather` where ArrDelay <> 'ArrDelay' and ArrDelay <> 'NA') group by UniqueCarrier order by max_delay desc limit 1;
```

## Spark Tasks
Run `python spark.py`. We apply **Linear Regression** on the weather dataset. We set the column "Year" as the label and the rest columns as the features.
### Dependency

- pyspark
