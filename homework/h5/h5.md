## Ex .1 - Numerical stability

1. A higher precision in a big data context will grant a method greater stability, the ability to react more precisely with small perturbation.
2. 

```matlab
tic
for a = 1:100
    x = rand(1000,100);
    svd(x);
end
toc

tic
for a = 1:100
    x = rand(1000,100);
    svd(x');
end
toc

tic
for a = 1:100
    x = rand(1000,100);
    A = eig(x * x');
end
toc

tic
for a = 1:100
    x = rand(1000,100);
    A = eig(x' * x);
end
toc
```

The result is as follows:

```
Elapsed time is 0.364459 seconds.
Elapsed time is 0.299080 seconds.
Elapsed time is 5.254796 seconds.
Elapsed time is 0.193208 seconds.
```

We can see that calculate the eigenvalue of $XX^T$ takes significantly longer time than other methods.
